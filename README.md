## How to Use
- Install the requirements 
- Run the script `python3 main.py`
- Open the network html file found at `graph.html`

## How it Works
The implementation involves three key components:

1. Semantic Relational Graph: I created a function, `create_similarity_graph_and_distance_matrix`, to construct a network graph and a distance matrix. In this graph, nodes represent words, and edges connect words with a cosine similarity above 0.3. I transformed the edge weights from the -1 to 1 cosine similarity scale to a more interpretable 0-1 scale.

2. Hierarchical Cluster Diagram: Using the `create_hierarchical_cluster_network` function, I leveraged the distance matrix to create a dendrogram that visually represents word groupings based on semantic distances.

3. Network Visualization: With the `visualize_graph` function, I utilized Pyvis to generate an interactive network diagram, showcasing words and their transformed similarity scores.

## Hyperparameters

The similarity threshold is the hyperparameter in which the system operator can adjust. Adjusting the threshold significantly impacted the network's density. A lower threshold included more edges, leading to a denser graph, while a higher threshold resulted in a sparser, more manageable network. The transformation of similarity into relational weights posed a challenge. I needed to decide whether the network should represent only positive relations or encompass all relations, including negative ones. This systemâ€™s linear transformation and similarity threshold can be combined to change the underlying network to represent both positive and negative relationships.
